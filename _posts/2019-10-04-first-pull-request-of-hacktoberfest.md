title: "First Pull Request of HacktoberFest"

I submitted my first pull request of HacktoberFest to ramapi. I noticed that there were 2 typos in the README and figured it would be a good first pull request practice in somebody’s repository. ramapi is a python wrapper for [rickandmortyapi.com](rickandmortyapi.com's) JavaScript API. I will be looking into both of these repositories further as its a fun way to understand how API’s are made, to grab data from a server.
