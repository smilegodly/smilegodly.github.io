This week I worked on 2 different Open Source projects. The internal open source project at school for the Planet CDOT website , and also a external open source project in github.com/microsoft/vscode.

I had noticed an open issue that wanted all of the ‘Edit in settings.json’ clickable texts in the settings editor to become buttons as it would be more obvious while tabbing for accessibility users..
I noticed above that there was a ‘Add Patern’ button int the settings editor already, and so I decided to replicate that button, but, for the ‘Edit in settings.json’ text.

The internal open source project I worked on some of the documentation , and also a function which extracts URLs from a blog post’s html text and then returns an array of the URLs that were extracted.
Originally I had written this function in python, but I was asked to re-do it in javascript using nodejs..
