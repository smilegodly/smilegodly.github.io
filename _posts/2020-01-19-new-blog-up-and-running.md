We did it. This website is finally up and running. 
The way this website was created is actually pretty neat (powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com))

I'll only have to write markdown from now on! The contents that I write in markdown for my blog will automatically get injected into this site...
Any time I want to add a post or change something .. this whole website will automatically generate a new page for the future content I'll be posting or regenerate if I change a layout.
All of the html you see on this website was automatically generated with Jekyll through prior layouts that I've specified.
