Whiteboardapp is the application I have made for lab 2 in OSD600. How it works is, all input that the user types through into the whiteboardapp is constantly being written to a SQLite database which is located inside of the users own browser client.

I’ve added paperCSS to the whiteboardapp to make the text on the whiteboard look more relaxed and visually pleasing, and, I also added a .gif and a .png to make the page look more cool.

One feature I chose to implement on my own is a fadeIn & fadeOut feature using jQuery library for the “start typing” text & gif when clicked on/off.
