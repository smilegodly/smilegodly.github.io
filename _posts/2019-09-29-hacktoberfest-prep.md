I came across a API for Rick and Morty data.. [https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api)

There is a python wrapper for it called ramapi which could be cool to work on as well. It would be interesting to make an API for something someday, this is a good way to see how it can be done. [https://github.com/curiousrohan/ramapi](https://github.com/curiousrohan/ramapi)

Here is a front end web page example of some of the data you can get from the Rick and Morty API

<div class="post-li-format" markdown="1">

- I have made changes to ramapiâ€™s readme. (Typos)
- I want to make a front end web page to display character & location data from the API
- I want to try and make a searchByName(name) function that will search for the information given the name of the character
- I think it would be interesting to develop an API someday and this is a good place to start learning how that is done
